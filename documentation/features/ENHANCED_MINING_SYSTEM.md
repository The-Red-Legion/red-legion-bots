# Enhanced Sunday Mining System - Channel Switching Support

## üéØ Overview
The Sunday Mining System has been enhanced to support participants who switch between mining channels during operations. This addresses real-world scenarios where miners coordinate with dispatch, switch between mining areas, or handle refinery operations.

## ‚úÖ Completed Features

### 1. Dynamic Mining Channel Management
- **Database-driven channel configuration** (`mining_channels` table)
- **Admin commands** for adding/removing mining channels:
  - `/admin add_mining_channel` - Add new mining channels
  - `/admin remove_mining_channel` - Remove channels
  - `/admin list_mining_channels` - View all channels
- **Automatic fallback** to hardcoded channels if database unavailable

### 2. Enhanced Voice Tracking with Channel Switching
- **Multi-channel participation tracking** - Tracks time across all mining channels
- **Cumulative time calculation** - Aggregates total participation time
- **Primary channel detection** - Identifies the channel where most time was spent
- **Session-based tracking** - Enhanced data model for better analytics

### 3. UEX API Integration for Real-Time Pricing
- **Live ore pricing** for all 21 ore types
- **Bearer token authentication**: `4ae9c984f69da2ad759776529b37a3dabdf99db4`
- **Auto-calculation features** in payroll modal
- **Current market rates** display for transparency

### 4. Redesigned Payroll System
- **Payroll officer workflow** - Centralized calculation model
- **Time-based distribution** - Fair compensation based on participation time
- **Enhanced payroll modal** with UEX integration
- **Multiple display modes**: calculate, summary, prices

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Dynamic mining channels
CREATE TABLE mining_channels (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    channel_id VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    channel_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Enhanced participation tracking
CREATE TABLE mining_participation (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    member_id VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    username VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    channel_id VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    channel_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    session_duration INTEGER NOT NULL,
    total_session_time INTEGER NOT NULL,
    primary_channel_id VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    is_org_member BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Voice Tracking Enhancement
```python
# Global session tracking for channel switching
member_session_data = {}

async def on_voice_state_update(member, before, after):
    # Track cumulative time across channels
    # Detect primary channel assignment
    # Handle channel switching scenarios
    # Save enhanced participation data
```

### Payroll Calculation Logic
```python
def _calculate_participation_shares(self, participants_data, total_value):
    # Use enhanced participation data with channel switching
    # Calculate time-based distribution
    # Apply org member vs guest percentages
    # Return fair compensation based on total time
```

## üîÑ Channel Switching Scenarios Supported

### Scenario 1: Mining ‚Üí Dispatch ‚Üí Mining
- Miner starts in "Mining Alpha" (90 minutes)
- Switches to "Dispatch Central" for coordination (10 minutes)
- Returns to "Mining Alpha" (20 minutes)
- **Result**: 120 minutes total, Primary Channel: Mining Alpha

### Scenario 2: Split Mining Operations
- Miner works in "Mining Beta" (60 minutes)
- Switches to "Mining Charlie" for different ore (30 minutes)
- **Result**: 90 minutes total, Primary Channel: Mining Beta

### Scenario 3: Refinery Coordination
- Miner in "Mining Delta" (45 minutes)
- Switches to "Refinery Alpha" for processing (15 minutes)
- Returns to "Mining Delta" (30 minutes)
- **Result**: 90 minutes total, Primary Channel: Mining Delta

## üìä Key Benefits

1. **Fair Compensation**: Time-based distribution ensures fair payouts regardless of channel switches
2. **Real-World Workflow Support**: Accommodates actual mining operation patterns
3. **Enhanced Analytics**: Better data for understanding mining operations
4. **Operational Flexibility**: Miners can coordinate without losing participation credit
5. **Accurate Time Tracking**: Cumulative tracking provides precise participation metrics

## üéÆ Command Reference

### Mining Commands
- `/sunday_mining_start` - Start tracking mining session
- `/sunday_mining_stop` - Stop tracking and save session data
- `/payroll calculate` - Calculate payroll distribution with UEX pricing
- `/payroll summary` - View current participation without calculating
- `/payroll prices` - Display current UEX ore prices

### Admin Commands
- `/admin add_mining_channel <channel> <name> [description]`
- `/admin remove_mining_channel <channel>`
- `/admin list_mining_channels`

## üîÆ Usage Flow

1. **Admin Setup**: Add mining channels using admin commands
2. **Session Start**: Use `/sunday_mining_start` to begin tracking
3. **Mining Operations**: Participants join various mining channels
4. **Channel Switching**: System automatically tracks movement between channels
5. **Session End**: Use `/sunday_mining_stop` to save participation data
6. **Payroll Calculation**: Officer uses `/payroll calculate` with total ore value
7. **Distribution**: System calculates fair shares based on cumulative time

## üõ°Ô∏è Data Integrity

- **Fallback mechanisms** for database connectivity issues
- **Automatic channel detection** for mining operations
- **Session validation** to ensure accurate tracking
- **Error handling** for edge cases and network issues

## üèÅ Next Steps

The enhanced Sunday Mining System is now ready for production use with full channel switching support, providing fair and accurate compensation for all mining participants regardless of their coordination patterns during operations.
