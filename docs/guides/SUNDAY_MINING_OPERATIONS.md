# Sunday Mining Operations Guide

## üéØ Overview

The Red Legion Sunday Mining Operation is a collaborative mining session where org members work together across multiple mining channels and receive **equal pay distribution** based on participation time. This guide explains how the system works and how payments are calculated.

## ‚õèÔ∏è How Sunday Mining Works

### **Step-by-Step Process**

1. **Session Start** - A leader uses `/redsundayminingstart`
   - Bot joins **Dispatch/Main** channel as visual indicator
   - Voice tracking begins across all 7 mining channels
   - Mining event is created in database

2. **Mining Operations** - Participants join voice channels
   - Voice tracking monitors participation across all channels
   - Participants can switch between channels freely
   - Minimum 30 seconds participation required for payment
   - System tracks total time spent across all channels

3. **Session End** - Leader uses `/redsundayminingstop`
   - Voice tracking ends, bot leaves channels
   - Participant summary is displayed
   - Session data is finalized for payroll

4. **Payroll Calculation** - Officer uses `/redpayroll calculate`
   - Enter total ore amounts collected
   - System calculates value using live UEX market prices
   - **Equal distribution** to all participants based on time
   - PDF report generated for records

## üí∞ Payment System

### **Equal Pay Distribution**
- **All participants receive equal pay per hour** - no distinction between org members and guests
- Payment is **purely time-based**: `Individual Payout = (Your Time / Total Time) √ó Total Value`
- **Multi-channel support**: Time across all mining channels is aggregated
- **Fair switching**: No penalty for moving between mining areas

### **Example Calculation**
```
Total Mining Value: 1,000,000 aUEC
Total Participant Time: 10 hours

Participant A: 2 hours ‚Üí 200,000 aUEC (20%)
Participant B: 3 hours ‚Üí 300,000 aUEC (30%) 
Participant C: 5 hours ‚Üí 500,000 aUEC (50%)
```

### **Payment Requirements**
- ‚úÖ Minimum 30 seconds voice channel participation
- ‚úÖ Must be present during active mining session
- ‚úÖ Time is automatically tracked across all 7 mining channels
- ‚úÖ No manual time entry required

## üé§ Monitored Voice Channels

The system tracks participation across **7 mining channels**:

| Channel | Purpose | Channel ID |
|---------|---------|------------|
| **Dispatch/Main** | Coordination & Bot Indicator | `1385774416755163247` |
| **Alpha** | Mining Team 1 | `1386367354753257583` |
| **Bravo** | Mining Team 2 | `1386367395643449414` |
| **Charlie** | Mining Team 3 | `1386367464279478313` |
| **Delta** | Mining Team 4 | `1386368182421635224` |
| **Echo** | Mining Team 5 | `1386368221877272616` |
| **Foxtrot** | Mining Team 6 | `1386368253712375828` |

### **Channel Usage Patterns**
- **Dispatch/Main**: Coordination, logistics, refinery operations
- **Alpha-Foxtrot**: Active mining operations in different areas

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

### **Q: Do org members get paid more than guests?**
**A: No.** All participants receive **equal pay per hour** regardless of org membership status. Payment is purely time-based.

### **Q: What if I switch between mining channels?**
**A: No problem.** The system tracks your time across **all channels** and combines it for payment calculation. You can freely move between Dispatch, Alpha, Bravo, etc.

### **Q: How long do I need to participate to get paid?**
**A: Minimum 30 seconds.** Very short visits are filtered out, but any meaningful participation (30+ seconds) qualifies for payment.

### **Q: How are ore values determined?**
**A: Live UEX market prices.** The system uses current market rates with 4-minute refresh intervals to ensure fair and accurate valuations.

### **Q: Can I see my participation time?**
**A: Yes.** When the session ends with `/redsundayminingstop`, you'll see a complete summary of all participants and their time breakdown.

### **Q: What if I'm in multiple channels at once?**
**A: Not possible.** Discord only allows one voice channel at a time. The system tracks when you switch between channels and aggregates all your time.

### **Q: How do I know if a session is active?**
**A: Look for the bot in Dispatch/Main channel.** When the bot is present in the Dispatch channel, it means voice tracking is active.

## üöÄ Best Practices
