This branch is dedicated to implementing improvements and enhancements to the Sunday Mining module.

## ✅ Completed Enhancements

### 💰 Enhanced Payroll System with Donations (v2.1.0)
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Commit `3ea6443`

**Major Features Implemented:**
- **🎁 Donation System**: Participants can voluntarily donate their earnings to other miners
- **💎 Editable UEX Prices**: Custom price editing for each ore type during payroll calculation  
- **📋 Multi-Step Workflow**: Guided process from event selection to final distribution
- **🔄 Dynamic Recalculation**: Real-time updates when donations or prices change

**Technical Implementation:**
- `ParticipantDonationView`: Interactive participant selection interface
- `UEXPriceSetupView`: Individual ore price editing with live updates
- `PriceEditModal`: Modal dialogs for precise price adjustments
- `EnhancedPayrollCalculationModal`: Final calculation with donation redistribution logic

**Enhanced User Experience:**
1. **Event Selection** → Select mining event for payroll
2. **Donation Selection** → Choose participants who want to donate earnings  
3. **Price Setup** → Review and edit UEX ore prices as needed
4. **Final Calculation** → Enter SCU amounts, auto-calculate with custom prices
5. **Enhanced Distribution** → Shows base payouts + donation bonuses separately

**Payroll Logic Improvements:**

- Donated amounts redistributed proportionally among non-donating participants
- Enhanced embed clearly shows donors vs recipients with bonus amounts
- Maintains full backward compatibility with existing payroll system

## 🎯 Future Enhancement Areas
