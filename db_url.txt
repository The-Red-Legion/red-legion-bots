# Database connection is now managed through GCP Secret Manager
# The DATABASE_URL environment variable or Secret Manager contains the connection string
# 
# For testing, you can temporarily add a connection string here (one line, no comments):
# postgresql://username:password@host:port/database
#
# Production uses: Secret Manager -> database-connection-string
